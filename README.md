## Welcome to the Vortex Gloves Git hub page! 
I'm not an expert so help is always welcome, but I'll do my best to help you get started! Best of luck to all of us!

### Installation
In order to get started first you'll need to set up Arduino IDE
Download the latest version of the program for your operating system here
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 

### Setup 
Next we'll need to configure Arduino to work with our hardware!
The board we're using is called the Trinket m0 by Adafruit, and they have a fantastic guide on how to set up Arduino to support it. Just make sure to use the reccomended board versions below.
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino/arduino-ide-setup
##### Arduino SAMD Boards(32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+) v1.6.20
##### Adafruit SAMD Boards v1.5.14
The latest versions don't work with one of our libraries so you'll get errors if you don't use the ones listed above. 

### Library Setup
Lastly we need to copy the libraries folder to the directory C:\Users\YourPCName\Documents\Arduino
This should give arduino everything it needs to work with the Vortex Gloves!
Make sure to exit all Arduino IDE windows and restart the program to finalize the installation!
